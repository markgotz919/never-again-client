My goal for the website was to create a way for users to save lists of things they never want to do again.  The idea for this website came to me when I was thinking about what would be the opposite of all the "bucket-list", and "to-do" websites.  I thought woudn't it be great to be able to keep a list of things you don't want to do again.

It is fun to be able to come up with different ideas for a website, but I find it difficult to design and plan the way single page websites should look.  It is also sometimes hard to work under tight deadlines.  It is also frustrating to keep track of variables, and in the future I will try to keep a running list of the variables I use for reference.  

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS-

In the future I plan to redesign the layout so that there can be a delete button and a change button next to each item in the list so users don't have to type in the ID number to change or delete items.    Also I would like to be able to improve the layout so that it is easier to read.  I also would like to be able for users to share items by being able to send a link to friends with their latest NEVER-AGAIN ITEMS.
